This approach simulates real-world cyberattacks to identify vulnerabilities in an organization's systems, applications, and networks.","PHI - Protected health information (PHI) is a specific category of sensitive data linked to an individual's health and healthcare. Subject to strict regulations to protect patient confidentiality, PHI is crucial for delivering healthcare, processing insurance claims, and conducting medical research.","PII - PII encompasses any data that can directly or indirectly identify an individual. This includes seemingly harmless details like name, address, and phone number, alongside highly sensitive information like Social Security number and medical records. Combined, even apparently innocuous PII can build detailed profiles, exposing individuals to identity theft, fraud, and privacy violations.","Policy Management - Policy management is indeed the process of developing, communicating, and maintaining policies and procedures within an organization. This encompasses various steps, including the creation of policies to outline rules, guidelines, and expectations for employee behavior and organizational practices. Additionally, policy management involves ongoing maintenance and updates to ensure that policies remain current, aligned with regulatory requirements, and reflective of evolving organizational needs and priorities.","Purpose Limitation (CCPA) - As mandated by CCPA Section 1798.100, businesses must restrict personal information (PI) usage to the intended collection purposes. This requires clarity in data gathering and transparency about how information will be utilized.","Pseudonymization - Data pseudonymization acts as a crucial shield for sensitive information, replacing identifiable elements with pseudonyms or codes. This privacy-enhancing technique keeps the original data secure even if the pseudonymized version is breached, as they're stored separately. Essentially, the transformation makes it difficult to link the anonymized data back to specific individuals, protecting their privacy while still allowing valuable insights to be extracted."]},{term:"R",items:["Ransomware - This type of malware encrypts files on a device, rendering them inaccessible. The attacker offers a decryption key in exchange for payment, but recovery is not guaranteed even after ransom demands are met.","Right Of Access - Individuals possess the right to request and receive their personal data from businesses or organizations holding it. This empowers them to understand how their information is being used and stored.","Right To Be Forgotten - Similar to the right to deletion, this grants individuals the right to request the erasure of their personal data under specific conditions as defined by regulations like GDPR. This strengthens individual control over online presence and data minimization practices.","Right To Be Informed (GDPR) - As stipulated by GDPR Article 13, businesses must inform data subjects at the time of collection about the personal data gathered, its purpose, retention period, and who it will be shared with. This transparency empowers individuals to make informed choices about data sharing.","Right To Correct - Individuals have the right to request corrections or amendments to inaccurate personal information held by businesses or organizations. This ensures data accuracy and protects individuals from potential harm due to inaccuracies.","Right To Deletion - This grants individuals the right to request and obtain the deletion of their personal data from businesses or organizations possessing or controlling it. This reinforces individual control over their information and data privacy.","Risk Assessment (Cyber Security) - A systematic process identifying and analyzing vulnerabilities and potential threats within an organization's cybersecurity posture. This proactive approach aims to detect existing security weaknesses, evaluate the potential impact of security incidents, prioritize risks based on likelihood and severity, and recommend effective mitigation strategies to minimize vulnerabilities and enhance overall security posture."]},{term:"S",items:["Security Operations Center (SOC) - A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized unit within an organization responsible for monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents and threats. The primary objective of a SOC is to protect the organization's information systems, networks, and data from security breaches and unauthorized access.","Sensitive Data - Information protected due to legal, ethical, privacy, financial, or other concerns. Examples include health data, personal information, trade secrets, etc.","Sensitive Data Discovery And Classification - A process identifying and categorizing sensitive information within an organization's digital assets. This includes PII, financial data, healthcare records, and other information requiring protection.","Sensitive Information - Data requiring safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, protecting individuals or organizations. According to NIST, compromised access to this data could adversely affect national interests, privacy rights, or government programs. GDPR further categorizes this as 'sensitive personal data' including private opinions and health information requiring enhanced protection.","Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information - Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) includes any data that can be used to identify an individual and is subject to heightened protection measures to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure."]},{term:"T",items:["Tokenized Data - A security technique that replaces sensitive data with a non-sensitive 'token.' This token acts as a stand-in, allowing authorized systems to access and process the data without exposing the original information. Deciphering the token back to the original data requires a secure 'tokenization system,' making unauthorized access highly unlikely. Random numbers are often used to create these secure tokens."]},{term:"U",items:["Unstructured Data - Unlike structured data with a defined format, unstructured data lacks a predetermined organization or schema. This category often includes text-heavy content like emails, documents, and social media posts, facts, figures, and time-series data, images, audio, and video files, sensor data, and logs. Due to its varied nature, unstructured data can be challenging for computers to analyze compared to structured data stored in databases or annotated documents. Estimates suggest unstructured data makes up the majority of global data and continues to grow rapidly.","Unmanaged Data Stores - Unlike cloud-based services with managed options, unmanaged data stores require complete support from internal development or infrastructure teams. This additional work might be necessary for data sovereignty, security, or resource needs exceeding the capabilities of a provider's Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) offering in terms of size or IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)."]},{term:"V",items:["Vulnerability - A vulnerability is a weakness in an internal control, system security procedure, information system, or implementation that can be exploited by a threat actor. These weaknesses can manifest as deficiencies in design, configuration, or procedures, potentially leading to security or privacy risks (or both)."]},{term:"W",items:["Whaling - Whaling, a targeted phishing attack, specifically hooks high-value individuals or key decision-makers. Hackers meticulously gather personal and professional details about these targets, crafting personalized messages that appear legitimate.
