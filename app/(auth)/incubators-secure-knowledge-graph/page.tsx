        Graphene's Secure Knowledge Graphs use a smart system, including machine learning, to create a detailed map of how different pieces of information connect. This map helps in making smart decisions across various cloud systems. It shows different kinds of information, how they are, and how they relate to each other. By understanding information this way, with the help of machine learning, it helps deal with important security issues.

        <p>
        Graphene's Knowledge Graphs, with the added power of machine learning, help in understanding complicated relationships between different pieces of information. They find new knowledge without needing experts to do a lot of hard work. This means specialists can use this new knowledge without spending too much time on complicated analyses.
