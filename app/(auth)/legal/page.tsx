In order to determine the most appropriate retention periods for your personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of your information, the reasons for which we collect and process your personal information, and applicable legal requirements.

          </p><br /><br />

          </p><br />
          <p className='subText'><span className='font-bold'>Processing of Data. </span> Abluva shall only Process such Personal Data in accordance with Customer’s written instructions from time-to-time (including as set out in the Agreement, or as provided as submissions through the Services) or as required for Abluva to provide, manage and facilitate the provision of the Services.

Abluva’s current Sub-Processors are listed on Schedule A hereto. Abluva shall give Customer reasonable prior written notice of Abluva’s appointment of any new Subprocessor, including reasonable details of the Processing to be undertaken by the Subprocessor.

Customer shall notify Abluva of any objection to such modifications of the DPA within thirty (30) days’ of Abluva’s dispatch of such modified DPA. If Abluva does not receive any objection from Customer within this thirty (30) day period, Customer will be deemed to have accepted such modifications and such modifications will become binding and enforceable as part of this DPA. Should Customer submit objections to Abluva within the above-referenced thirty (30) days, Customer and Abluva agree to discuss and negotiate in good faith any such necessary modifications to this DPA to address the changes with a view to agreeing and implementing modifications as mutually agreeable to both Customer and Abluva as soon as is reasonably practicable but no later than thirty (30) days following Abluva’s receipt of Customer’s objections.
