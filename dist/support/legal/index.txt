In addition to, and without limiting, the foregoing obligations, to the extent Abluva Processes any Personal Data subject to the CCPA, Abluva (a) shall not further collect, use, retain, access, share, transfer, or otherwise Process Personal Data for any purpose not related to providing the Services and shall not retain, use, or disclose Personal Data outside of the direct business relationship between Customer and Abluva; and (b) is prohibited from “selling” Personal Data (as defined under Section 1798.140(t) of the CCPA). Pursuant to Section 1798.40 the CCPA, Abluva hereby certifies that it understands and agrees to and shall comply with the restrictions set forth under clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 5.1. Abluva promptly inform Customer if, in its opinion, the Customer’s instructions infringe or violate any Data Protection Laws, or if Abluva is unable to comply with the Customers’ instructionsb:T4fc,Customer gives a general authorization to Abluva to disclose Personal Data to Sub-Processors; provided that, each Sub-Processor shall be bound by a written agreement which imposes on the Sub-Processor the same data protection obligations as are imposed on Abluva under this DPA to the extent applicable to the nature of the service provided by the Sub-Processors. Where the Sub-Processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such agreement, Abluva shall remain fully liable towards Customer for the performance of the Sub-Processor’s obligations under such agreement. Abluva’s current Sub-Processors are listed on Schedule A hereto. Abluva shall give Customer reasonable prior written notice of Abluva’s appointment of any new Subprocessor, including reasonable details of the Processing to be undertaken by the Subprocessor. If, within seven (7) business days of receipt of that notice, Customer notifies Abluva in writing of any objections (on reasonable grounds) to the proposed appointment, then Abluva shall not appoint (nor disclose any Personal Data to) the proposed Subprocessor. If Customer does not provide notice of its objections to the new subprocessor within such seven (7) day period above, then the Subprocessor shall be deemed accepted.c:T512, Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in this DPA, if any change in Data Protection Laws may require or result in any variation to this DPA, Abluva will modify this DPA as necessary to incorporate such change(s) and provide a copy of the modified DPA to Customer. Customer shall notify Abluva of any objection to such modifications of the DPA within thirty (30) days’ of Abluva’s dispatch of such modified DPA. If Abluva does not receive any objection from Customer within this thirty (30) day period, Customer will be deemed to have accepted such modifications and such modifications will become binding and enforceable as part of this DPA. Should Customer submit objections to Abluva within the above-referenced thirty (30) days, Customer and Abluva agree to discuss and negotiate in good faith any such necessary modifications to this DPA to address the changes with a view to agreeing and implementing modifications as mutually agreeable to both Customer and Abluva as soon as is reasonably practicable but no later than thirty (30) days following Abluva’s receipt of Customer’s objections. If Customer and Abluva are unable to reach agreement on modifications to this DPA within such thirty (30) day time period, Abluva may terminate the Agreement without notice to
