New technologies, new threats, and new regulations are all driving changes in the way that organizations protect their data.</p><p class="font pt-7 text-xs text-gray-400">14 Dec 2023</p></div></div></div><section class="p-5 md:px-72 md:pb-10 sm:py-8"><div><p class="subText pt-5">In this article, we will explore some of the key changing paradigms in data security. We will discuss the impact of the changing nature of data, the need for compliance and regulations, and geopolitical requirements. We will also provide some best practices for developing and implementing effective data security strategies in this changing landscape.</p><br/><br/><p class="mainText">The Changing Nature of Data</p><br/><p class="subText">Data is becoming increasingly diverse and complex. Traditional structured data, such as data stored in relational databases, is still important. These were followed by non-relational databases (NoSQL, Document, Graph databases). The organizations are increasingly collecting and storing unstructured data, such as text, images, and video. Unstructured data can be more difficult to protect than structured data because it is often difficult to identify and classify.</p><br/><p class="subText">In addition, data is increasingly being stored and processed in a variety of different data stores, including relational databases, NoSQL databases, data lakes, and cloud storage. This makes it more challenging to implement and manage security controls across all of the different data stores.</p><br/><p class="primary-color italic text-lg">&quot;The changing nature of data is one of the most defining trends of our time. Data is becoming increasingly diverse, complex, and abundant. This is creating new opportunities for business and governments, but it is also posing new challenges.&quot; - BoozeAllen</p><br/><p class="subText">Finally, many organizations are now operating in multi-cloud environments, with data stored and processed in multiple different cloud providers. This makes it even more complex to implement and manage security controls.</p><br/><br/><p class="mainText">The Need for Compliance and Regulations</p><br/><p class="subText">In addition to the changing nature of data, organizations also need to consider compliance and regulations when developing their data security strategies. Many industries are subject to data security regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States. These regulations require organizations to protect the personal data of their customers and employees. Organizations also need to comply with other regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for organizations that process credit card payments.</p><br/><br/><p class="mainText">Geopolitical Requirements</p><br/><p class="subText">Organizations that operate in multiple countries also need to consider the geopolitical requirements of each country. For example, some countries may have restrictions on the transfer of data outside of the country. Organizations need to carefully assess their compliance requirements and geopolitical risks in order to develop a data security strategy that meets their specific needs.</p><br/><br/><p class="mainText">Other Challenges in the Changing Landscape</p><br/><p class="subText">The changing nature of data is creating new challenges for data security professionals. Organizations need to develop and implement new security strategies to protect their data in the changing landscape.</p><br/><br/><p class="mainSubText">Here are some of the key challenges to data security in the changing landscape:</p><br/><p class="subText"><ul class="list-disc md:ml-10 ml-5"><li>The increasing volume and complexity of data: Organizations are collecting and storing more data than ever before. This data is often complex and unstructured, making it more difficult to protect.</li><br/><li>The proliferation of data sources: Data is now being collected from a wider variety of sources than ever before, including IoT devices, social media, and public data sources. This makes it more challenging to implement and manage security controls across all of the different data sources.</li><br/><li>The rise of new technologies: New technologies, such as AI and ML, are being used to collect, store, and process data. These new technologies can introduce new security risks.</li><br/><li>The changing threat landscape: Cybercriminals are constantly developing new ways to attack data. Organizations need to be prepared for the latest threats.</li></ul></p><br/><br/><p class="mainText">Securing Data in the Changing Landscape</p><br/><p class="subText">The changing nature of data is creating new challenges for data security professionals. Organizations need to develop and implement new security strategies to protect their data in the changing landscape.</p><br/><br/><p class="mainSubText">Here are some key best practices for securing data in the changing landscape:</p><br/><p class="subText"><ul class="list-decimal md:ml-10 ml-5"><li>Adopt a zero trust security architecture. Zero trust security is a security model that assumes that no user or device can be trusted by default. All users and devices must be verified and authorized before they can access any data or resources. This is in contrast to the traditional perimeter-based security model, which assumes that all users and devices inside the perimeter are trusted. <br/>Zero trust security is a more effective way to protect data in the changing landscape because it takes into account the fact that data is now being stored and accessed from a variety of locations, including on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments. Zero trust security also takes into account the fact that cybercriminals are increasingly sophisticated and are using new techniques to attack data.</li><br/><li>Use AI and ML to detect and respond to threats. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can be used to analyze security data and identify potential threats before they can cause damage. AI and ML can also be used to automate security tasks, such as incident response and threat hunting. AI and ML are becoming increasingly important for data security in the changing landscape because the volume and complexity of data is increasing rapidly. AI and ML can help organizations to keep up with the latest threats and to respond to them more quickly and effectively.</li><br/><li>Implement security controls across all data stores. Organizations need to have visibility into all of the data stores that they are using and implement appropriate security controls for each data store. This includes data stores that are on-premises, in the cloud, and in hybrid environments. Security controls for data stores can include encryption, access control, and data loss prevention. Organizations need to choose the right security controls for each data store based on the sensitivity of the data and the risks associated with the data store.</li><br/><li>Secure data in the cloud. Many organizations are now using cloud computing to store and process data. Cloud computing offers a number of benefits, such as scalability, flexibility, and cost savings. However, cloud computing also introduces new security risks.<br/>Organizations need to implement security controls to protect data in the cloud. These security controls can include encryption, access control, and identity and access management (IAM). Organizations also need to choose a cloud provider that offers strong security features.</li><br/><li>Manage compliance and geopolitical risks. Organizations need to carefully assess their compliance requirements and geopolitical risks in order to develop a data security strategy that meets their specific needs. Compliance requirements are the laws and regulations that organizations must comply with. These requirements can vary depending on the industry and the location of the organization. Geopolitical risks are the risks associated with operating in different countries. These risks can include data sovereignty laws, censorship laws, and cyberwarfare.<br/>Organizations need to develop a data security strategy that takes into account their compliance requirements and geopolitical risks. This strategy should include measures to protect data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.</li><br/><li>Develop a data security culture. A data security culture is one in which all employees are aware of the importance of data security and take steps to protect the organization&#x27;s data. Organizations can develop a data security culture by providing training and education to employees, implementing security policies and procedures, and monitoring employee compliance. A data security culture is important in the changing landscape because cybercriminals are increasingly targeting employees in order to gain access to data.</li><br/><li>Have a plan in place for responding to data breaches. Data breaches are a reality of today&#x27;s world. Organizations need to have a plan in place for responding to data breaches. This plan should include steps for identifying and containing the breach, notifying affected individuals, and recovering from the breach.</li><br/><li>Invest in security technology. Organizations need to invest in security technology to protect their data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. Security technology can include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, data encryption, and access control systems. A good data security should provide Access control systems, Data depersonalization, Governance and Compliance, with comprehensive Audit and reporting capabilities. Organizations need to choose the right security technology for their needs based on the size of the organization, the industry, and the budget.</li></ul><br/><p class="primary-color italic text-xl text-center">&quot;Security is not a cost centre, it&#x27;s an investment&quot; - Robert Gates</p><br/><span class="mainSubText">Abluva’s Graphene provides a comprehensive set of solutions to protect organisation’s data from breaches and protect it even after a breach.
