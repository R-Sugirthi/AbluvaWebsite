          <p className='mainText'>“Cookies” Explained and Why They are Used</p><br />
          <p className='subText'>A cookie is a small piece of data (text file) that a website – when visited by a user – asks your browser to store on your computer or device in order to remember information about you, such as your IP address, device identifier, language and/or currency preference or login information. You can find more information about cookies at: www.allaboutcookies.org or www.youronlinechoices.eu.</p><br />
          <p className='subText'>We also use a range of similar technologies that are deployed when you visit a website, and/or may be embedded in the web pages and/or emails you receive, and typically stored on your computer, device and/or web browser, including, “web beacons” and/or “tracking tags” which are small graphics, which may be invisible to you, that have a unique identifier and are embedded in the web pages you visit and/or email message you receive, and “embedded scripts” which are programming codes that are designed to collect information about your interactions with our Websites, such as the links you click on.</p><br />
          <p className='subText'>We’ll use the term “cookie” throughout this Cookie Policy to cover all of these technologies, but we’ll make sure we provide you with clear details about them all so that you can make informed choices about your cookie settings.</p><br />
